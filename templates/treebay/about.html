					<p>Nowadays, plants have become an essential part of our lives, yet we rarely pay much attention to
					their impact on us. Nevertheless, entering a room full of your favourite flowers will <strong>brighten up
					your day</strong> instantly! Our team strives to make that possible for everyone. Say, you've taken good care
					of a big pot of herbs for years, but now you move house and can't take it with you. This website
					will help you find someone who would love to adopt your plants. Or let's say you've made a few
					attempts to grow a magnificent orchid but every time you buy one it just dies after a couple of
					months despite your effort. Now you have the chance to find an orchid looking for a new home and
					discuss every little detail about its needs with the experienced owner. <strong>Whatever your favourite
                    plant is, here you will find one that's just right for you! :) </strong></p>
